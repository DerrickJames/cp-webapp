# Wall Of Fame - React Client

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DerrickJames/wall-of-fame-react.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/DerrickJames/wall-of-fame-react)

This is the client-side implementation of the Wall Of Fame project using React. It is meant to be a playground to test out different ideas and approaches
gathered over time as a software developer from various books, articles,
tutorials and experiences on large scale system architectures,
design patterns, best practices and generally the way I think about elegant
code.
